# FutureHouse

#### Introduction

This the webpage of our dataset named *FutureHouse* which is proposed in the paper, "PhyIR: Physics-based Inverse Rendering for Panoramic Indoor Images" ([Project page](http://yodlee.top/PhyIR/)). 

#### Download

Please send an email to yodlee@mail.nwpu.edu.cn with some necessary information and we will send a download link to you. 

Note that the size of illumination data is large and we have not finished the processing of illumination data. So we will provide all labels except for illumination first and will send you the download link of illumination once  it is released.
